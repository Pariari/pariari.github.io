      <description>About P2P Ngariung Pari and Gudskul are excited to present P2P Ngariung an eight-week online program of learning for arts collectives* and individuals based in Australia and Indonesia. &amp;ldquo;Ngariung&amp;rdquo; is a Sundanese word (Sunda are a West Javanese tribe) that has made its way into broader use in Java. Ngariung is a gathering, often to discuss and learn to find a solution to a problem. Ngariung has a fairly broad meaning, but the common thread is to have an opinion, listen, and hopefully, find a solution.</description>

      <description>P2P is a program of virtual sharing between Pari and artist-run collectives and spaces around the world. Through a series of online workshops with friends near and far, we hope to collectively engage with ideas and models for collaboration and criticality within and beyond the arts.
For this first iteration, Pari teamed up with Gudskul and The White Pube for a series of online workshops and studio visits.
The following videos and diagrams were created from the conversations we had and issues raised during the P2P workshops.</description>
