      <title>Glass</title>

      <description>Autonomous, reflective and playful, Glass is a voyeuristic dive into the ways in which we look at ourselves and others. If the ego is a constructed self, then Glass is the vulnerable space of seeing the self and being seen. In this exhibition, the power dynamics of the gaze are interrogated to create a space for reclamation and self-documentation.</description>

      <title>Pollen</title>
      <link>https://pariari.org/programming/07-pollen/</link>

      <description>Pollen is used for transferring DNA; it carries the memory of its previous form. In the past, there was a predictability to the seasons but as the world shifts, unexpected forms develop in response. In this exhibition, the artists speculate on personal and cultural histories, from local sonic subcultures to temporary infrastructure to global drift. Pollen is an exercise in the collective imagining of alternate worlds that could germinate from this current time and place.</description>

      <title>5 From 5 (at Carriageworks)</title>

      <description>5 from 5 is Pari‚Äôs first trip east. As a new artist-run space on Darug land in the shifting cityscape of Parramatta, this is our debut off-site project.
Pari is run by a group of nine directors who work in a collaborative and flat structure. We make decisions communally on the program, artists, operations and everything that happens in the space.
The artists in this mini-exhibition have been selected collectively by the Pari team‚Äîone from each of the five exhibitions since our space officially opened in October 2019.</description>

      <title>Mixed Business 2</title>

      <description>Mixed Business may feel a little different this year. Last year, we gathered in 40 degree heat, our souls fed in this space through art, community, and, of course, good food. Over the course of the past year, our senses of time and place were discombobulated. The places where we gathered shifted as we re-adapted, and continue to adapt, to what will become a well-versed adage known as ‚Äúunprecedented times.‚Äù</description>

      <title>Lemonade</title>

      <guid>https://pariari.org/programming/05-lemonade/</guid>
      <description>Bitter and sweet, nostalgic and transformational, Lemonade is making the best of your circumstances; it is transforming adversity into something beautiful that can be savoured and shared. It is persistence, self-care, wry humour and generosity. This lemonade is not saccharine ‚Äî there‚Äôs always that hint of acid, of something sharp and honed ‚Äî but the edges are softened and warmed over time.
Lemonade is a bit old wisdom, a bit BeyonceÃÅ, and all fresh.</description>

      <description>Coming in to bat next is Sports Show üèÜ Connecting an all-star lineup of seasoned players and rookies, Pari presents live commentary of the on-and-off field behaviour of sport ‚Äì the highs and lows, wins and losses.
We‚Äôve smashed our salary cap with this one with support from City of Parramatta.
The game of the season that‚Äôs not to be missed. Just another day in #parradise üèà
In lieu of a regular opening, we will be meeting in Parramatta Park between 2-4pm on Sunday 13th September, where we can keep a safe distance and hopefully get some sun (it&amp;rsquo;ll be postponed if it rains).</description>

      <title>Companions</title>

      <description>In Companions, materials are active partners in each practice, and the subsequent works are collaborations: the result of a push and pull between human and non-human companions.
The artists in Companions choose to work with materials and processes that are not stable or fixed. Things that respond, often unpredictably, to light, air and time. Some of the materials are living, and continue to grow and morph. Others will dry, decay or eventually die.</description>

      <title>Mixed Business</title>
      <link>https://pariari.org/programming/02-mixedbusiness/</link>

      <description>Not long ago, it seemed like mixed businesses were on almost every street corner in Parra. They‚Äôre still here, mostly in the surrounding suburbs: next to roundabouts, between apartment blocks and houses mid-renovation. Little family-run businesses stocking contradictory products side-by-side on rickety shelves. Some tins host dust and dead bugs; other shelves are perpetually empty, signalling what‚Äôs important to the 100 people in the immediate area.
Pari invokes the mixed business as a mode of operation, for multiplicity and exchange: a cornerstore(stone) for community and convenience.</description>

      <title>10 Degrees Hotter</title>
      <link>https://pariari.org/programming/01-10degreeshotter/</link>

      <description>10 Degrees Hotter was almost the name of this gallery but we couldn‚Äôt all agree. Some thought it sounded like a boy band, others thought it was a mouthful. The phrase came out of a way of describing the conditions of being in Western Sydney‚Äî on any regular summer day, it can be five to ten degrees hotter in the west compared to out east. This artificial climate is created by the urban heat island effect, where hot air gets trapped in the vast concrete expanse between the mountains and the coast.</description>
