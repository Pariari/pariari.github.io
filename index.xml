      <description>Pari is a new artist-run initiative in Parramatta. We are for art that tells stories that need to be told, sheds new light on old thinking, or tackles new ideas altogether. We are for getting you to Parra, or making it so that you don’t have to leave here to come together over new, challenging, boundary-pushing art. We are for bringing art and ideas to Western Sydney audiences, and bringing audiences from elsewhere to experience art in the crane-hogging, uber-developing, beautifully contradictory and diverse place we call Parramatta, in the geographical centre of Sydney’s urban sprawl, in the heart of unceded Darug territory.</description>

      <description>Coming in to bat next is Sports Show 🏆 Connecting an all-star lineup of seasoned players and rookies, Pari presents live commentary of the on-and-off field behaviour of sport – the highs and lows, wins and losses.
We’ve smashed our salary cap with this one with support from City of Parramatta.
The game of the season that’s not to be missed. Just another day in #parradise 🏈
In lieu of a regular opening, we will be meeting in Parramatta Park between 2-4pm on Sunday 13th September, where we can keep a safe distance and hopefully get some sun (it&amp;rsquo;ll be postponed if it rains).</description>

      <description>In Companions, materials are active partners in each practice, and the subsequent works are collaborations: the result of a push and pull between human and non-human companions.
The artists in Companions choose to work with materials and processes that are not stable or fixed. Things that respond, often unpredictably, to light, air and time. Some of the materials are living, and continue to grow and morph. Others will dry, decay or eventually die.</description>

      <description>P2P is a program of virtual sharing between Pari and artist-run collectives and spaces around the world. Through a series of online workshops with friends near and far, we hope to collectively engage with ideas and models for collaboration and criticality within and beyond the arts.
For this first iteration, Pari has teamed up with Gudskul and The White Pube to host the following workshops online:

      <title>Mixed Business</title>
      <link>https://pariari.org/programming/02-mixedbusiness/</link>

      <description>Not long ago, it seemed like mixed businesses were on almost every street corner in Parra. They’re still here, mostly in the surrounding suburbs: next to roundabouts, between apartment blocks and houses mid-renovation. Little family-run businesses stocking contradictory products side-by-side on rickety shelves. Some tins host dust and dead bugs; other shelves are perpetually empty, signalling what’s important to the 100 people in the immediate area.
Pari invokes the mixed business as a mode of operation, for multiplicity and exchange: a cornerstore(stone) for community and convenience.</description>

      <title>10 Degrees Hotter</title>

      <description>10 Degrees Hotter was almost the name of this gallery but we couldn’t all agree. Some thought it sounded like a boy band, others thought it was a mouthful. The phrase came out of a way of describing the conditions of being in Western Sydney— on any regular summer day, it can be five to ten degrees hotter in the west compared to out east. This artificial climate is created by the urban heat island effect, where hot air gets trapped in the vast concrete expanse between the mountains and the coast.</description>
