			<div >
				<p>5 from 5 is Pari’s first trip east. As a new artist-run space on Darug land in the shifting cityscape of Parramatta, this is our debut off-site project.</p>
<p>Pari is run by a group of nine directors who work in a collaborative and flat structure. We make decisions communally on the program, artists, operations and everything that happens in the space.</p>
<p>The artists in this mini-exhibition have been selected collectively by the Pari team—one from each of the five exhibitions since our space officially opened in October 2019. The process of curating this project has allowed us to reflect on our first year or so, and our fledgling steps of creating an artist-run and community space for western Sydney. Taken together, the works represent some of the core principles of Pari’s program—reflecting the intersections of the social, political and personal, as well as bringing local western Sydney artists in conversation with artists from beyond.</p>
<p>Artists: Richmond Kobla Dido (Kobla Photography), Leila El Rayes, Kath Fries, Mehmet Mevlütoğlu, Feras Shaheen</p>
<p>Curated by Kalanjay Dhir, Talitha Hanna and Tian Zhang</p>
